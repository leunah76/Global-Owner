# Global-Owner
This project is a web application where you can list-up your property information to manage your property investment status.

Living in Singapore for several years, I have seen many people investing (or wishing to invest) in foreign properties.

However, investing in properties involves lots of costs such as stamp duties, legal fees, or agent fees. There are also many information that you need to keep well such as the agency information or tenant information if you are renting it out.

In the Global-Owner app, you can keep record of all these information and also get some basic information on the costs involved in buying and selling properties in major South East Asian countries. You can also have a selling scenario if you wish to sell the property.

I have developed this app as my final project for CS50, and currently the app is only available for few South East Asian countries. However, I hope that someday, there will be a real web app that includes much more countries information from all different continents.
